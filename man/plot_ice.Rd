\title{Plotting the incremental cost-effectiveness plane.}
\usage{
plot_ice(
  df,
  e_int,
  e_comp,
  c_int,
  c_comp,
  col = NULL,
  n_it = NULL,
  wtp = NULL,
  currency = "euro"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{a dataframe.}

\item{e_int}{character. Name of variable of the dataframe containing total effects of the intervention strategy.}

\item{e_comp}{character. Name of variable of the dataframe containing total effects of the comparator strategy.}

\item{c_int}{character. Name of variable of the dataframe containing total costs of the intervention strategy.}

\item{c_comp}{character. Name of variable of the dataframe containing total costs of the comparator strategy.}

\item{col}{character. Name of variable of the dataframe to use to colour (in blue) the plotted dots. Default is NULL which results in grey dots.}

\item{n_it}{(vector of) numeric value(s). Designate which iteration should be coloured in the colour red.}

\item{wtp}{numeric. Default is NULL. If different than NULL, plots a linear line with intercept 0 and the defined slope.}

\item{currency}{character. Default is "euro". Determines the currency sign to use in the incremental cost effectiveness plane. Currently included signs: "euro", "dollar", "yen", "none".}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 graph.
}
\description{
This function plots the incremental cost-effectiveness plane for two strategies.
