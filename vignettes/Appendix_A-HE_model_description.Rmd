# Description
This Appendix describes the probabilistic model inputs and outputs of the mock health economic model developed to tests the functionalities of the Probabilistic Analysis Check dashBOARD (PACBOARD). The HE model and functions are available at https://github.com/Xa4P/pacheck. The inputs and outputs value are stored within the `df_pa` object of the `pacheck` package. The `df_pa` object is obtained by running the `01-data_preparation.R` R script.  

# Model description  
The HE model compares two strategies, called "intervention" and "comparator" for the treatment of mestatatic breast cancer. We used a yearly cycle and a time horizon of 30 years. We did not apply half cycle correction.  

## Model structure & assumptions
A cohort-based Health State Transition Model model with three health states was developed. The health states were: "Progression-free" (PF), "Progressed disease" (PD), and "Dead" (D). All individuals of the cohort start in the PF health state and can progress to the PD health state or to the D health state. Once individuals are in the PD health state, they cannot transit back to the PF health state but they can transit to the D health state. The D health state is the absorbing health state. The model structure is provided below.  
The "comparator" strategy does not incur any treatment or adverse event-related health losses and costs. Adverse events are assumed to occur once at the start of the health economic model.

# Model inputs
The probabilistic model inputs were estimated based on the below-described distribution and parameter estimates, using the `generate_pa_inputs()` function.  

| Parameter name | Description | Mean value | Standard Error (or 95%CI) | Distribution |
|:---------------|:------------|:-----------|:--------------------------|:-------------|
| `p_pfspd` | Probability of transiting from PF to PD | 0.15 | | Dirichlet |
| `p_pfsd` | Probability of transiting from PF to D | 0.1 | | Dirichlet |
| `p_pdd` | Probability of transiting from PD to D | 0.2 | | Beta |
| `p_ae` | Probability of experiencing an adverse event (intervention only) | 0.05 | | Beta |
| `rr` | Relative risk of progression (PF to PD) of the intervention versus the comparator| 0.75 | 0.62-0.88 | Lognormal |
| `u_pfs` | Utility value of health state PF | 0.75 | 0.07 | Beta |
| `u_pd` | Utility value of health state PD | 0.55 | 0.1 | Beta |
| `u_ae` | Utility decrement when experiencing an adverse event | 0.15 | 0.05 | Beta |
| `c_pfs` | Annual costs of health state PF | 1000 | 200 | Normal |
| `c_pd` | Annual costs of health state PD | 2000 | 400 | Normal |
| `c_thx`| Annual costs treatment (intervention) | 10000 | 100 | Normal | 
| `c_ae` | Costs of treating an adverse event | 500 | 100 | Gamma |
| `r_d_effects` | Annual discount rate effects | 0.015 | - | FIXED |
| `r_d_costs` | Annual discount rate costs | 0.04 | - | FIXED |

# Analysis
A probabilistic analysis of 10,000 iterations was performed through Monte Carlo analysis. Input and intermediate and final output values for each iteration were recorded. The recorded outputs were:  
- `t_ly_int` & `t_ly_comp`: total discounted life years for each strategy  
- `t_ly_d_int` & `t_ly_d_comp`: total undiscounted life years for each strategy  
- `t_qaly_int` & `t_qaly_comp`: total discounted quality-adjusted life years for each strategy  
- `t_qaly_d_int` & `t_qaly_d_comp`: total undiscounted quality-adjusted life years for each strategy  
- `t_costs_int` & `t_costs_comp`: total discounted costs for each strategy  
- `t_costs_d_int` & `t_costs_d_comp`: total undiscounted costs for each strategy  
- `t_ly_pfs_d_int`, `t_ly_pd_d_int`, `t_ly_pfs_d_comp` & `t_ly_pd_d_comp`: discounted life years per health state for each strategy  
- `t_qaly_pfs_d_int`, `t_qaly_pd_d_int`, `t_qaly_pfs_d_comp` & `t_qaly_pd_d_comp`: discounted quality-adjusted life years per health state for each strategy  
- `t_costs_pfs_d_int`, `t_costs_pd_d_int`, `t_costs_pfs_d_comp` & `t_costs_pd_d_comp`: discounted costs per health state for each strategy  
- `t_qaly_ae_int`: total QALY decrement associated with the occurrence of adverse events  
- `t_costs_ae_int`: total costs associated with the occurrence of adverse events  
- `inc_ly`: incremental (discounted) life years of the intervention versus the comparator   
- `inc_qaly`: incremental (discounted) quality-adjusted life years of the intervention versus the comparator   
- `inc_costs`: incremental (discounted) costs of the intervention versus the comparator   
The probabilistic analysis is performed using a for loop and the function `perform_simulation()`.  

# Results
The intervention results in `r round(mean(df_pa$inc_ly), 2)` incremental life years, `r round(mean(df_pa$inc_qaly), 2)` incremental quality-adjusted life years, and `r paste("\u20ac", round(mean(df_pa$inc_costs), 0))` incremental costs versus the comparator. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio of the intervention versus the comparator is `r paste("\u20ac", round(mean(df_pa$inc_costs) / mean(df_pa$inc_qaly), 0))` per QALY.  
The probabilistic results of this HE model are provided in the table below and are plotted in an incremental cost-effectiveness plane and a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve.
